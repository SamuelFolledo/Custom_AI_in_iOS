# How to Create an Machine Learning Model from scratch and use it in an iOS app

This is a tutorial on how to create your own Machine Learning model from scratch and how to use it in your iOS app. 

## ML Model Type
This tutorial will be a YOLO (You Only Look Once) type of machine learning model as speed is a huge requirement for mobile devices. YOLO is one of the **single stage detectors** that runs the classifier once on the input image and do all of the work in a single pass.

## Tools and Tech Stacks
### Machine Learning Tools
- **[IBM Cloud Annotation](https://cloud.annotations.ai/)** - for labeling our dataset
- **Jupyter Notebook** - run our Python codes as well as creating, training, and saving our machine learning model
- **Libraries** - TuriCreate, Pandas
### iOS Development Tools
- **Xcode** - best IDE for iOS development
- **Libraries** - CoreML, UIKit
